    <p>
      Thank you for using Grok Pins! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle
      your information when you use this Chrome extension.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="font-bold">Data Collection and Use</p>
    <p>
      As of the current version (0.0.1), Grok Pins
      <span class="font-bold"
        >does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable
        information (PII)</span
      >, such as your email address, name, or unique identifiers. The extension
      operates locally within your browser and does not transmit any data to
      external servers or third parties.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="font-bold">Storage Permission</p>
    <p>
      The extension uses the Chrome storage API to save user pinned chats
      locally on your device. This data is not sent anywhere and is only used to
      enable the core functionality of the extension.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="font-bold">Future Updates</p>
    <p>
      In future versions, Grok Pins may collect limited personally identifiable
      information, such as an email address or a generated unique identifier
      (UUID), to better identify users using the free or the premium version of
      Grok Pins. If this occurs:
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      - We will update this Privacy Policy to detail what data is collected,
      why, and how it&rsquo;s protected.
    </p>

    <p>
      - You will be notified of these changes via the Chrome Web Store or within
      the extension.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Any collection will comply with applicable privacy laws and be optional
      where possible.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="font-bold">Third-Party Sharing</p>
    <p>
      We do not share your data with third parties, as no data is collected in
      the current version.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="font-bold">Changes to This Policy</p>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy as the extension evolves. The latest
